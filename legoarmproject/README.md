# PA1473 - Software Development: Agile Project (Template)

## Template information
This template should help your team write a good readme-file for your project. (The file is called README.md in your project directory.)
You are of course free to add more sections to your readme if you want to.

Readme-files on GitHub are formatted using Markdown. You can find information about how to format using Markdown here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

Your readme-file should include the following sections:


## Introduction
Lego robot arm which can pick up a big lego block, determine it's color and place at designated drop of position.
This part should give a general introduction to your project.


## Getting started

This section is supposed to guide a new developer through the steps of how to set up the project and install the deppendencies they need to start developing.


## Building and running

This is where you explain how to make the project run. What is your startup procedure? Does the program accept different arguments to do different things?

You should also describe how to operate your program. Does it need manual input before it starts picking up and sorting the items?


## Features

- [x] US01: Pick up items.
- [x] US01B: Pick up items from a designated position.
- [x] US02: Drop off items.
- [x] US02B: Drop items off at a designated position.
- [x] US03: Determine if an item is present at a given location.
- [x] US04B: Robot to tell me the color of an item at a designated position.
- [x] US05: Drop items off at different locations based on the color of the item.
- [x] US06: Be able to pick up items from elevated positions.
- [x] US08B As a customer, I want to be able to calibrate items with three different colors and drop the items
off at specific drop-off zones based on color.
- [x] US09: As a customer, I want the robot to check the pickup location periodically to see if a new item has
arrived. 
- [ ] US10: As a customer, I want the robots to sort items at a specific time. 
- [ ] US11: As a customer, I want two robots to communicate and work together on items sorting without colliding with each other. 
- [x] US12: As a customer, I want to be able to manually set the locations and heights of one pick-up zone and two drop-off zones. (Implemented either by manually dragging the arm to a position or using buttons).
